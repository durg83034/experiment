* The saponification value of an oil or fat (lipids) is defined as the number of mg of potassium hydroxide required to neutralize the fatty acids resulting from the complete hydrolysis of 1 g of the sample. A soap is formed during the saponification, for example: C3H5(CI7H35COO)3+ 3KOH = C3H5(OH) 3 + 3 CI7H35Â·COOK Stearin Glycerol Potassium stearate.
* The esters of the fatty acids oflow molecular weight require the more alkali for saponification, so that the saponification value is inversely proportional to the mean of the molecular weights of the fatty acids in the glycerides present. 
* As many oils have somewhat similar values (e.g. those in the olive oil series fall within the range 188-196), the saponification value is not, in general, as useful for identification purposes as the iodine value. 
* The saponification value is of most use for detecting the presence of coconut oil (SV 255), palm-kernel oil (SV 247) and butterfat (SV 225), which contain a high proportion of the lower fatty acids. 
* The presence of paraffin hydrocarbons may be detected as cloudiness when water is added to the ethanolic saponified oil or fat solution. 

**Principle**

* When a fat is boiled with an excess of alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH), the triglycerides hydrolyse, and glycerol and soap are formed. The alkali consumed by 25 Practical Manual for Pulses and Oilseeds 26 this hydrolysis is a measure of the Saponification Value (S.v.).
* It is defined as the number of milligrams of potassium hydroxide (KOH) required to saponify completely one gram of the oil or fat.
