**Requirements**

1.  Potassium hydroxide 100g.
2.  Aldehyde free alcohol 100ml.
3.  Hydrochloric acid (0.5 N).
4.  Pipette 25 ml .
5.	Conical flask 250 ml.
6.	Few pieces of pumice .
7.  Phenolphthalein ( 1per cent)of 5ml.
8.  Burette.


* Melt the sample, if not already in liquid form, and filter.
* Ensure that the sample is free of impurities and moisture. 
* Weigh I to 2 g. of the sample into a 250 ml conical flask having a ground glass joint.
* Pipette 25 ml of alcoholic KOH solution and add a few glass beads or pieces of pumice. 
* Connect the flask to an air condenser at least 65 cm (or preferably 202 cm) long.
* Reflux the sample on a water bath or a hot plate for not more than 1hour.
* Boil gently but steadily until the sample is completely saponified as indicated by the absence of any oily matter       and appearance of clear solution. 
* Allow the flask and condenser to cool. 
* Wash the inside of the condenser with about 10 ml of hot ethyl alcohol neutral to phenolphthalein. 
* Add I ml of phenolphthalein indicator and titrate with standard HCI. 
* Conduct a blank determination alongside. 
* When testing samples which give dark coloured soap solution, the observation of the end point of the titration may be facilitated either by using (i) thymophthalein or alkali blue 6 B inplace of phenolphthalein, or (ii) an indicator containing 1 rnl of a 0.1% (w/v) solution of methylene blue in water to reach 100 ml of phenolphthalein (mixed before titration).
